## Environment Variables

To run this application, you need to set up environment variables in a `.env` file in the root directory. Below is an example of the variables needed:

```bash
- `DB_USER`: Your database username (e.g., `root`).
- `DB_PASSWORD`: Your database password (e.g., `123456`).
- `DB_NAME`: The name of your database (e.g., `bom_api`).
- `DB_HOST`: The host of your database (e.g., `localhost`).
- `DB_PORT`: The port your database is running on (e.g., `5432`).
- `DB_SSLMODE`: Set SSL mode (e.g., `disable` if SSL is not needed).
```

Ensure all these values are correctly set in your `.env` file before running the application.
